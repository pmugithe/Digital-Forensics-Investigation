Exhibits:

Network logs and internet history data recovered from the Dell CPi notebook computer, showing evidence of wireless traffic interception at public places such as coffee shops and airports. (See Exhibit A: Network Logs and Exhibit B: Internet History Data)

This exhibit contains copies of network logs recovered from the Dell CPi notebook computer found at the scene of the hacking incident. The logs provide evidence of wireless traffic interception activities, including the capture of network packets transmitted between wireless access points and client devices. The logs show that the suspect, Greg Schardt, was able to intercept sensitive information such as credit card numbers, usernames, and passwords, which he could then use for nefarious purposes.

Exhibit B: Internet History Data

This exhibit contains copies of internet history data recovered from the Dell CPi notebook computer found at the scene of the hacking incident. The data shows the suspect's online activities, including searches for hacking-related terms, visits to underground forums, and downloads of hacking tools and utilities. The internet history data provides additional evidence of the suspect's involvement in hacking activities, and helps to establish a pattern of behavior that is consistent with the charges against him.
